                                        I am trying to write an app using Ionic 4 with Angular 6. The app has tabs, and for each tab, depending on the state of the app, it should either show 1) task1 or 2) task2 which has a series of pages I should be able to click through as well as go back to previous page if I wanted to.
                                        
                                        I used the starter code "ionic start myApp tabs --type=angular" to have the tabs set up, and was trying to implement task2.
                                        
                                        I have encounter many problems with routing, especially with lazy loading, and relative routerLink and router.navigate, but I was able to avoid using those two, and instead load component directly, and use absolute path to navigate.
                                        
                                        However, now that I can navigate inside the FAQs tab to go to different pages via buttons, when I go to a different tab, and come back, the buttons goes to the right path, but the component doesn't render at all (I check the html, and the html for the page I want to go to, doesn't render)
                                        
                                        I don't really know why it is doing this.
                                        
                                        gif that shows the problem</p>
